# Rhythm Track Text
 A while ago, when friday night funkin' wasn't dead I heard about a problem where the arrows you have to hit are placed manually by the mapper, and aren't actually set to the music. A while later I decided I wanted to make something that could fix that issue with similar games that might be made in the future, so I wrote this little program in python, that parses a very simple set of instructions. None of the code looks very nice, but I'll probably rewrite this in C eventually, so don't worry about that. There's also like this one line that makes this whole thing probably not work on Linux, and I'll fix that too, but for now run it through Powershell.
